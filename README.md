This app creates a colour by combining the values in the sliders.
The top control is a UIView and its background is the colour that results by combining the 3 values of the sliders.
There are 3 switches (UISwitch). When the switch is off you canâ€™t interact with the slider next to the switch.
There are 3 sliders (UISlider). The minimum value is 0, the maximum value is 1.
The reset button turns all switches to off and all the sliders to the minimum value. It also updates the background colour of the view.
